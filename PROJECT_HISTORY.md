## CORS Handling

### Prompt 2: CORS Error Fix

### Prompt 3: CORS Policy Error
**User Request:** "The plugin is opening now but I'm getting this error in the Figma console: Access to fetch at 'https://www.tiqets.com/web_api/...' from origin 'null' has been blocked by CORS policy"

**Changes Made:**

## Property Selection System

### Prompt 4: Interactive Property Selection
**User Request:** "Allow me to select multiple properties from the json response including properties that are nested inside json objects and arrays"

**Changes Made:**
- Added interactive JSON property selector with checkboxes
- Implemented nested object and array property selection
- Added area to display selected properties
- Updated CSS styling for the new JSON explorer interface

**Key Features:**
- Property tree explorer with hierarchical structure
- Nested property support with visual indentation
- Type indicators with color coding
- Bulk selection (Select All/Select None)
- Selected properties display

### Prompt 5: Hide JSON Response & Expand/Collapse
**User Request:** "Hide the json response. In the property tree, keep the nested structure and only show me the records. Allow me to expand and collapse the objects and arrays in the records"

**Changes Made:**
- Hidden the raw JSON response display
- Added expand/collapse functionality for objects and arrays
- Maintained nested structure with visual hierarchy
- Added ▶/▼ toggle buttons for expandable items

### Prompt 6: Show All Properties from Records
**User Request:** "I'm not seeing some of the properties from the fetched json in the property tree. If one or more of the records in the fetched json has a property, display it in the property tree. Still keep the nested structure"

**Changes Made:**
- Modified property tree to collect all unique properties from all records
- Maintained nested structure while showing complete property coverage
- Used Map data structure for efficient property collection
- Added smart property extraction from multiple records

## Figma Integration

### Prompt 7: Layer Mapping to Figma
**User Request:** "Allow me to map the values of the selected properties to layers in Figma. The Figma layers can be targeted by their inputting their names in the plugin. So when I select a component in Figma and I have mapped the properties to targetted layers in Figma and I click an Apply to Figma button, the values to should copied to the targeted figma layers"

**Changes Made:**
- Added layer mapping interface with property-to-layer input fields
- Updated plugin code to handle layer mapping and value application
- Implemented layer finding and text updating in Figma
- Added Apply to Figma button functionality

**Key Features:**
- Property-to-layer mapping interface
- Automatic layer finding by name
- Text content updates to Figma layers
- Error handling for missing layers

### Prompt 8: Multiple Component Support
**User Request:** "If I select multiple components in Figma, apply the values of the first record to the first component, the values of second record to the second component, the values of third record to the third component etc."

**Changes Made:**
- Enhanced plugin to handle multiple selected components
- Implemented sequential record application (1st record → 1st component, etc.)
- Updated notification messages to show component and record counts
- Added support for processing multiple components simultaneously

### Prompt 9: Auto-fill Layer Names
**User Request:** "When I click on Show Selected, by default, set the target layer name to the property name"

**Changes Made:**
- Added automatic layer name pre-filling using property names
- Implemented smart property extraction (uses last part of nested paths)
- Made Apply to Figma button immediately enabled with pre-filled mappings
- Enhanced workflow efficiency

## UI Improvements

### Prompt 10: Larger Window & Full Width
**User Request:** "Make the plugin window 25% longer and 25% wider. Make the sections of the plugin stretch to the full width of the window"

**Changes Made:**

- Updated all sections to stretch to full width
- Added proper box-sizing and width properties
- Improved layout consistency across all UI elements

**User Request:** "Remove the cancel and Use CORS Proxy buttons. When the user clicks on Fetch Json button, run the use CORS function before fetching the json from the API"

**Changes Made:**
- Removed cancel and CORS proxy buttons
- Made CORS proxy automatic on JSON fetch
- Streamlined UI with single "Fetch JSON" button
- Updated help text to reflect automatic CORS handling

## Image Support

### Prompt 12: Image Loading & Application
**User Request:** "If a property in the property tree is for an image and it returns urls, then when I select it, map it to a layer in Figma and click on the Apply to Figma button get the image from the urls and apply it to the mapped layer"

**Changes Made:**
- Added image property detection logic
- Implemented automatic image URL detection
- Added visual indicators for image properties (purple badges)
- Created image loading and application functionality
- Enhanced plugin code to handle image fills

**Key Features:**
- Automatic image property detection
- Image loading from URLs with CORS proxy
- Image application as fills to Figma layers
- Support for various layer types (rectangles, frames, components)
- Enhanced error handling for image operations

### Prompt 13: Image Loading Fix
**User Request:** "When I have selected an image property, mapped it to a layer in Figma and clicked on the Apply to Figma button, the image from the url isn't replacing the fill of the mapped layer. Please fix"

**Changes Made:**
- Fixed image loading to use CORS proxy
- Enhanced error handling and debugging
- Improved layer type checking for image fills
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging

### Prompt 14: Layer Finding Fix
**User Request:** "I'm getting this error even though there is a layer named 'image' in the components: 'Layer "image" not found in component 1'"

**Changes Made:**
- Fixed `findLayerByName` function to search all layer types, not just text layers
- Added comprehensive debugging to show available layers
